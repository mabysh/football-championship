Burnley Football Club (/ˈbɜːrnli/) is a professional association football club based in Burnley, Lancashire. The team are playing in the Premier League, the highest level of English football in the 2016–17 season after winning the England's second tier league in the 2015–16 season in the Football League Championship. Nicknamed The Clarets, due to the dominant colour of their home shirts, they were one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888.

Burnley have been Football League Champions twice, in 1920–21 and 1959–60, have won the FA Cup once, in 1914, and have won the Community Shield twice, in 1960 and 1973. The Clarets also reached the 1961 quarter-finals of the European Cup. They are one of only three teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Preston North End.

The club colours of claret and blue were adopted in 1910 in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, Aston Villa. Their home ground since 1883 has been Turf Moor and their current manager is Sean Dyche.
