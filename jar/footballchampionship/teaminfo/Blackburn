Blackburn Rovers Football Club /ˈblækbɜːrn ˈroʊvərz/ is a professional association football club in Blackburn, Lancashire, England, which has competed in the Championship since being relegated from the Premier League, the top tier of English football, at the end of the 2011–12 season, coming only a season after the Venkys takeover of the club.

The club was established in 1875, becoming a founding member of The Football League in 1888. It is one of only three clubs to have been both a founder member of the Football League and the Premier League (the others being Aston Villa and Everton). In 1890, Rovers moved to Ewood Park. Blackburn Rovers have been English champions three times, and have won six FA Cups and one Football League Cup. Blackburn are the only extant club to have won three consecutive FA Cups. The club has spent the majority of its existence in the top flight of English football (72 years).

In 1992, Rovers gained promotion to the new Premier League a year after being taken over by local entrepreneur Jack Walker, who installed Kenny Dalglish as manager. In 1995, Rovers became Premier League champions. In the 1998–99 season, the club was relegated. It was promoted back to the Premier League two years later, in the 2000–01 season. It has qualified for the UEFA Cup four times: once as League Cup winners, twice as the Premier League's sixth-placed team and once via the Intertoto Cup. The 2011–12 season marked the club's 72nd, non-consecutive, year in the top flight. Rovers are currently one of only six clubs to have won the Premier League, along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Leicester City.

The club's motto is "Arte et Labore", "By Skill and Hard Work" in Latin.
